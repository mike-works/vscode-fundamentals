# Visual Studio Code

1. [Using It](./1_using/)
2. [Customizing It](./2_customizing/)
3. [Extending It](./3_extending/)

## A text editor, maybe a light IDE?

Over time we're seeing support for
   - Task running
   - Workspace-specific settings
   - A rich plugin ecosystem
   - Things that analyze your code in the background
   - A wide range of programming languages

<br><br><br><br>

## It's built using web technology, for web developers, the OSS way

👩‍💻 Delivering on features __and__ an ecosystem that's easy to jump into

🔌 Talks to web technologies more easily (i.e., Node talking to Node)

📖 Binaries are proprietary, but source code is open source

🗣 Close collaboration between the VS Code, Edge, Visual Studio and TypeScript teams

<br><br><br><br>

## Learning from past lessons

🚫 Don't make ANOTHER heavy IDE

🔒 Don't impose lots of opinions onto users

🤝 Favor open standards over proprietary formats
  - i.e., `.jsconfig`, `.editorconfig`

⌨️ Bring your keybindings with you

<br><br><br><br>

## Not just a new twist

🙌 Best cross-platform [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) development experience available
   - Leverages TypeScript technology to give you insight into your regular JavaScript

👌 A great .NET development experience on OS X and Linux
   - _finally_ an OS maker that doesn't lock us in

⏩ Doesn't require a week of tweaking/config to get "right"

🚢 Shipping new features at an incredible rate!

## How this course is going to work

Agenda is as follows
 1. [Using It](./1_using/)
 2. [Customizing It](./2_customizing/)
 3. [Extending It](./3_extending/)

New code editing tricks (i.e. `⌘ + D` along the way)

We'll be working with JavaScript *and* typescript.
  - It's OK (maybe even better) if you don't know TS yet
